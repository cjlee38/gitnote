# git-note
An ephemeral comment extension based on Git.

### Motivation
Upon joining a new company, settling into your workspace, and opening up the project for the first time, you're greeted
with an overwhelming expanse of code. As a professional programmer adept in various programming languages, you possess the
skills to analyze the code intricately. However, even experts might find themselves momentarily perplexed by
domain-specific terminology. Understanding the code's functionality is one thing, but retaining all those details to
construct a comprehensive view of the system's workings is an entirely different challenge.

While one could resort to jotting down memos in a text editor or elsewhere, correlating these notes with the mental map
of the system's architecture doesn't always come easily. This is where git-note comes into playâ€”a tool designed to allow
you to record your insights, comments, or notes directly related to the code while keeping them concealed from the
source code itself. These comments are accessible exclusively to you and can be seamlessly integrated with your IDE,
making it effortlessly easy to review your annotations within the context of the code.
